This is a complete thread switch.

It is like setjmp_full and longjmp_full together, except more so --
we cannot possibly synthesize it at present, but we ought to be able
to verify.

Like setjmp_full and longjmp_full it also lacks prologue/epilogue
material it might need on some platforms and the final return
instruction.
