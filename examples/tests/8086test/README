some stuff for ../casp/8086.casp:

add2.spec adds two registers
add2.prog is what it produces for me (looks to be correct)
add2-wrong.prog also verifies against it (and shouldn't)

mem.spec tries to read from memory, but for me generates an add instruction
(and, it's (ADD ax bx), which doesn't even involve the registers in the spec)

true.spec generates whatever it wants; I get (ADD sp cx).
