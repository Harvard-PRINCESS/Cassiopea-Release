This is a widget for extracting calling sequences from a C compiler.

Requirements:
   - the compiler must behave like a Unix compiler (understand flags
     like -S, -O2, etc.)
   - the compiler must understand simple gcc-style asm directives
     (gcc and clang do, others may vary)

Restrictions:
   - each output is good only for a specific call to a specific
     function with a specific signature
   - all arguments must fit in registers
   - the return value must fit in a register
   - floating point values are not accepted
   - without additional out-of-band knowledge must assume that all
     machine state and registers are destroyed by the call
