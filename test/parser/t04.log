../../cassiopeia: unknown option '-v'.
Usage: ../../cassiopeia [command] casp [files...] [options...]
       [command] := -interp | -verify | -synth | -sketch | -deduce |-extract

Cassiopeia accepts a command indicating what action it should perform.
A command might expect some files. The accepted file types are as follows:
 * prog : files containing a list of instructions
 * spec : files containing pre-/post-condition specs
The following describes flags and possible commands with their expected arguments:
  -interp [prog] [init]: interpret [prog] on starting state [init]
  -verify [spec] [prog]: verify [prog] against [spec]
  -synth [spec]: synthesize prog from [spec]
  -sketch [spec] [sketch]: synthesize prog from [spec] with [sketch]
  -deduce [spec] : synthesize prog from [spec]
  -extract [prog] : extract ASM from [prog]
  -bitsize : show approximate per-instruction search space size
  -o : set file for result output
  -l : set file for logging
  -smt : set file for smtlib dump
  -sv : print synthesis details
  --debug : enable debug logging mode
  --dump-interp : dump interpreter function calls
  --dump-solver : dump solver interaction
  --dry-run : cause CEGIS to always fail
  --max-insts : maximum instructions (default 4)
  --bucketed : synthesis with counter-example bucketing
  --accumulation-direct : synthesis with fine-grained candidate accumulation, 
  --accumulation-operation : synthesis with coarse-grained candidate accumulation, at operation level
  --accumulation-category : synthesis with coarse-grained candidate accumulation, at category level
  --sorting : synthesis with assembly instruction sorting
  --weak-coerce : use weaker coercion
  --no-unify : disable equality unification for specifications
  --no-depend : disable dependency assertions
  --no-branch : disable branching
  --use-cex-solver : set verification solver (z3, btor, yices) (z3 by default)
  --use-syn-solver : set synthesis solver (z3, btor, yices) (btor by default)
  --seed : set random seed for whitening and SMT solver
  --whiten : whiten [solver, logic, insts, args]
