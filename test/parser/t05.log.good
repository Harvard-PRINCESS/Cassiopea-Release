../../cassiopeia: unknown option '-v'.
Usage: ../../cassiopeia [command] casp [files...] [options...]
       [command] := -interp | -verify | -synth | -sketch | -deduce |-extract

Cassiopeia accepts a command indicating what action it should perform.
A command might expect some files. The accepted file types are as follows:
 * prog : files containing a list of instructions
 * spec : files containing pre-/post-condition specs
The following describes flags and possible commands with their expected arguments:
  -interp [prog] [init] : interpret prog file with state state
  -verify [spec] [prog]: verify prog against spec
  -synth [spec]: synthesize prog from spec
  -sketch [spec] [sketch]: synthesize prog from spec with sketch
  -deduce [spec]: synthesize prog from spec
  -extract [prog] : extract ASM from prog file
  -o : set file for result output
  -l : set file for logging
  -smt : set file for smtlib dump
  -sv : print synthesis details
  --debug : enable debug logging mode
  --dump-interp : dump interpreter function calls
  --dump-solver : dump solver interaction
  --use-cex-solver : set verification solver (z3, btor, yices) (z3 by default)
  --use-syn-solver : set synthesis solver (z3, btor, yices) (btor by default)
  --max-insts : maximum instructions (default 4)
  --bucketed : synthesis with counter-example buckets
  --accumulation : synthesis with candidate accumulation
  --sorting : synthesis with assembly instruction sorting
  --no-unify : disable equality unification for specifications
  --no-branch : disable branching
  --seed : set random seed for whitening and SMT solver
  --whiten : whiten [solver, logic, insts, args]
