Regression tests for cassiopeia.

To run, in here do:
	bmake
or to parallelize (not enough tests yet to make this worthwhile),
	bmake -j4

To clean up explicitly, bmake clean.

This will first run all the tests and then print all the test diffs.

Note that any diff output is a "failure"; it indicates a change in
behavior. Sometimes it means you broke something; sometimes it means
the reference files need to be updated; sometimes both. Every diff
should be investigated.

(Managing the program output so as to get good test coverage while
minimizing the number of nuisance diffs resulting from ordinary
changes is something of an art and has not been done yet in any way.)

When you have confirmed that all test diffs are intentional changes
and either harmless or reflect improvements/fixes, you can do "make
good" to update all the reference files. Don't do this without
thinking.

If we end up needing multiple levels of reference files to cope with
intentional temporary regressions, let me know; I've been there on
other projects and it can be handled.

The framework requires bmake. (gmake doesn't cut it.) bmake is good
for this kind of test automation.
